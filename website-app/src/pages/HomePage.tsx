      <p>
        I am Lorenzo D’Auria, born in Trieste (Italy) in 1997. At the end of my
        bachelor’s degree in Engineering in Electronics and Computer Science, I
        have understood that automation engineering is the IT topic I am most
        interested in. Therefore for my thesis work, I have chosen to develop
        from scratch a self-balanced inverted pendulum using a reaction wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following my passions, I have then moved to Rome to study robotics
        during my master’s degree. The experience of living on my own made me
        grow from a personal point of view, while the more practical approach
        found at Sapienza University allowed me to refine other important skills
        such as teamwork, self-reliance, organization, and English as well. For
        my master thesis, I have decided to work on the development of an
        innovative safe navigation algorithm for UAVs obtaining very
        satisfactory results.
      </p>
      <p>
        During 2022, I worked for Alten Italia as a System Engineer. More
        specifically, I was a part of the Leonardo Avionic Sensors Simulation
        team in Ronchi dei Legionari (GO), Italy as an external consultant. I
        was involved in the development of real-time systems for flight
        simulators, and I mainly worked with Visual Studio, GitLab, and the Qt
        Framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        From January 2023 I am employed at Fincantieri, where I am part of the
        Digital Innovation team for the study and development of new solutions
        in the fields of Robotics, AI and IoT, with the goal of improving the
        shipyard efficiency and security. I mainly work with Python, C++, ROS,
        Azure, Git and Unix in general.
